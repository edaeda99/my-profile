    <h2>ART 🎨<h2>
	<p> 
	 I am passionate about art. I love visiting museums and art galleries. It's never just about "looking" at art. Ideas appear as the eyes touch the visual displays. In reality, the moment you start observing your emotional responses, you've created "art." You can use your mind to become more visual by becoming more conscious of what you're feeling. </p>

	<h2>MY FAVORITE ARTIST 🎨<h2>
	<p> 
	 Andy Warhol is one of my favorite artists. He is considered one of the most important representatives of the pop art movement. Pop Art is an art form that first appeared in postwar Britain and America. The movement ushered in a modern and interactive approach to art, marked by an interest in popular culture and innovative interpretations of consumer goods. You can find his wonderful artworks. </p>

     <h2>SPORT 🎾 🏐<h2>
	 <p> 
	  Sport is always my passion. Since 10 years, I play volleyball. When I was 12, I started play tennis. I have been doing workout and going to the gym for the last 5 years. For the future, I am planning to start kickboxing.</p>
